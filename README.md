# week-4-game

This is a basic crystal collection game. A random number provides a target for the player, who clicks on four randomly valued
crystals to try to reach the target goal. Hitting the target results in a win and game win audio, while going over the target
results in a loss and game loss audio.  The game resets automatically after a win or a loss and continues until the user
exits the browser.
